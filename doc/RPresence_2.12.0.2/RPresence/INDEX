print_one_site_estimates
                        Print real param estimates for i-th site only
                        'print_one_site_estimates' Prints real param
                        estimates for ith site only
psi_cond                get conditional occupancy estimates from
                        single-season ("so") model 'psicond' Computes
                        conditional (on detection history) occupancy
                        estimates from single-season ("so") model.
                        Uses "delta" method, with numerical gradient.
read.pao                Read a pao data object.
simplify_dm             simplify design matrix by replacing all
                        individual covariates which are all one or zero
                        with '1' or '0' in the design matrix.  This
                        makes the design matrix much easier to read and
                        faster for the model. 'simplify_dm' Replaces
                        ind. covariates which are all 0 or 1, with 0 or
                        1.
